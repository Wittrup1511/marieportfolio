					<p>When I was 13 I got my first job as a kid handing out newspapers. After that I got a job at Niverødgårds malerisamling in Nivå. When I was 15 I got a job at McDonalds in Hørsholm/Kokkedal, where I was in 5 years. I became a trainer and almost a leader.
					<br>
						I took some chef classes at the Hotel and </p>
						<p class="p2">Restuarentschool in Valby. I worked at Comwell in Holte for a short period of time before I realised that it wasnt for me.
					<br>
					I have always had a big intrest in IT and that is why I started at Cphbusiness in Lyngby as a multimediadesigner. I just moved to Frederiksberg and im currently working as a bartender at the bar Atlanta in Copenhagen</p>
